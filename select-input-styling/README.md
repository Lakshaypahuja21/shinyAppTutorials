# Select Input Styling

Since the last update of this demo application, I have created the [Shiny listbox example](https://github.com/davidruvolo51/shinyAppTutorials/tree/prod/shiny-listbox) as a replacement/alternative to this demo. This demo still works, but the methods in this app are outdated and will no longer be maintained. (Updates as of 23 October 2020)

Questions or comments are always welcome. Feel free to open a new issue.
