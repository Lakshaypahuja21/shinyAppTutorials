# Time Input

A time input element does not exist for shiny applications. There are a number of packages and widgets available; however, we can easily create one using the browser native `type="time"`. This shiny application demonstrates how to structure the input and register it with shiny for use in your server code. 

A longer tutorial is underway. Until then, you can clone this repo and run the application locally.
