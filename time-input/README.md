# Time Input

A time input element does not exist for shiny applications. There are a number of packages and widgets available; however, we can easily create one using `type="time"`. This shiny application demonstrates how to structure the input and register it with shiny for use in your server code. You can find more infomation in the blog post [creating a custom time input](https://davidruvolo51.github.io/shinytutorials/tutorials/time-input/).

## Getting Started

You can run this app locally using the following methods: running within your R environment or cloning this subdirectory.

### Running in your R environment

You can run this app within your R environment using the `runGithub` function. Enter the following command in the console.

```r
shiny::runGitHub(username = "davidruvolo51", repo = "shinyAppTutorials", subdir = "time-input")
```

### Cloning the subdirectory

You can clone the data editor subdirectory using `git sparse-checkout`.

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/davidruvolo51/shinyAppTutorials
cd shinyAppTutorials
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set time-input
```

Then you can run the shiny app in your preferred R environment.
